🚀 Predictive Maintenance – Production-Grade ML System

A production-ready predictive maintenance system that detects upcoming machine failures using industrial sensor data.
The project demonstrates end-to-end AI engineering, from data ingestion to deployment, monitoring, and drift detection.

Built with a strong focus on real-world ML systems, not notebooks or toy examples.

🧠 Problem Statement

Industrial machines generate high-frequency sensor data during operation.
Unexpected failures are expensive and disruptive.

Goal:
Predict whether a machine is likely to fail within the next 30 operating cycles, enabling proactive maintenance.

📊 Dataset

NASA CMAPSS Turbofan Engine Dataset

Multivariate time-series sensor data

Failure occurs at the final cycle of each engine

Target Definition

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is computed per engine

Binary label:

1 → failure within next 30 cycles

0 → otherwise

🔧 Key Engineering Decisions
✅ Leakage-Safe Training

Data split is done by engine ID, not randomly by rows

Prevents future information leakage — critical for time-series ML

✅ Feature Contract Enforcement

Model is trained only on engineered features

Inference strictly validates feature count and order

Prevents silent prediction errors in production

✅ Configuration & Reproducibility

Deterministic pipelines

Explicit dependency pinning

Experiment tracking via MLflow

🧩 Features
🔹 Feature Engineering

Rolling window statistics (mean, std)

Captures degradation trends rather than single sensor snapshots

🔹 Model Training

RandomForest baseline (robust, interpretable)

Recall-focused evaluation (missing failures is costly)

🔹 Experiment Tracking

Parameters, metrics, and artifacts logged using MLflow

🔹 Inference API

FastAPI service with:

/health endpoint

/predict endpoint

Pydantic input validation

🔹 Monitoring & Drift Detection

Inference data logged in production

Evidently compares training vs production distributions

Drift reports generated automatically

🌐 API Usage
Start API
uvicorn src.inference.app:app --reload

Health Check
GET /health

Prediction
POST /predict


Request body:

{
  "features": [0.12, 0.15, 0.18, ..., 0.42]
}


Response:

{
  "will_fail_soon": 0,
  "probability": 0.000085
}

📈 Drift Monitoring

After collecting inference logs:

python src/monitoring/drift.py


Output:

HTML drift report comparing training vs production data

Feature-level drift statistics

This enables post-deployment model reliability checks.
